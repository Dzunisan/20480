# Module 10: Implementing an Adaptive User Interface

# Lesson 2: Creating an Adaptive User Interface

### Demonstration: Implementing an Adaptive User Interface

#### Preparation Steps

Ensure that you have cloned the 20480C directory from GitHub (**https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/20480-Programming-in-HTML5-with-JavaScript-and-CSS3/tree/master/Allfiles**). It contains the code segments for the labs and demos in this course.

#### Demonstration Steps

1.	Read the lab scenario to the students and point out that they should read each scenario before attempting the lab for a module.
2.	Point out to the students that the exercise scenario for each exercise contains a description of what they will accomplish in the exercise, and is also essential reading.
3.	Start Microsoft Visual Studio, and then from the **Allfiles\Mod10\Labfiles\Solution\Exercise 2** folder, open the **ContosoConf.sln** solution.
4.	On the **Debug** menu, click **Start Without Debugging**.

>**Note**: If the **Intranet settings are turned off by default** message appears, click **Don’t show this message again**.

5.	In **Microsoft Edge**, on the navigation bar, click **About**.
6.	Press F10 to display the menu bar.
7.	On the **File** menu, click **Print preview**. Point out that the layout of the **About** page is modified to suit a printer; there is no navigation bar, and the text is displayed without splitting it up into three columns.
8.	Close the **Print Preview** window.
9.	In **Microsoft Edge**, press F12 to display the **F12 Developer Tools** window.
10.	On the **Tools** menu, point to **Resize**, and then select **480 x 800**. Point out that the **Microsoft Edge** window changes size and matches that of a handheld device.
11.	Close the **F12 Developer Tools** window.
12.	In **Microsoft Edge**, notice that the layout of the navigation bar has changed; it is displayed over two lines, and the **Register Free** link is no longer displayed.
13.	Close **Microsoft Edge**.
14.	In **Solution Explorer**, expand the **ContosoConf** project, expand the **styles** folder, and then double-click **print.css**.
15.	In the **Code Editor** window, show the CSS styles in this file. Mention that students will create this style sheet to format pages when they are sent to a printer.
16.	In **Solution Explorer**, double-click **mobile.css**.
17.	In the **Code Editor** window, scroll through the file and explain that it contains the styles used by the application when it runs in a narrow window matching that of a handheld device.
